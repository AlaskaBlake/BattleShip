FEB 3 2020:
Spend an hour in class discussing the project, and writing and reviewing user stories, and categorizing user stories into tasks. 

FEB 7 2020:
Spend 20 minutes setting approximate work-time to each task. 

FEB 9 2020:
Spend two and a-half hours with Blake working on the first user-stories. Having two people work on it, the thinking process is alot easier because there's feedback and discussion throughout the process. (wrote by Theng on Blake account)

FEB 15 2020:
Work on game logic and game play (3rd and 4th user-stories) with Blake for 2 hours. 

FEB 15 2020:
Spend an hour 30 minutes working on babyproofing inputs alone. Testing and trying to see if anything breaks took the longest. It would be easier if we implemented something to help us do this.

FEB 16 2020:
Work with Blake on dumb AI and refactoring codes for 3 hours. We estimated AI to takes a few hours, and it turn out it does.

FEB 18 2020:
Spend one and a half hour fixing ship placement bug.

FEB 19 2020:
Spend an hour with Blake commenting codes.

FEB 19 2020:
Spend two hours and 30 minutes fixing inputs bug and refactoring condition statements and runing last test
before wrapping it up for presentation.

Summary:

Overall, we working together and doing pair programming allows us to get more process than we thought, because beside the feedback and discussion, it also allows us to be more focus and not get distracted. Nevertheless, Blake and I had been working together for quite sometime, so we knows how each other code which make things easier for us. Overall we do have fewer bugs, but there is still some bugs that is not obvious and we have to dig for it by doing test run. I believe we did choose better name for variable and function overall because we always ask each other for a name instead of just put what come to our mind first.
